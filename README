TimeIT Server is a time tracking tool and as such has two purposes.

1. To be a central hub for multiple TimeIT clients
(https://github.com/Hoglet/TimeIT) so that all clients have the
same data.

2. To be able to use through a web browser as a simple time logging
tool.

The databases are decentralized which means that all nodes, including the
server, works stand alone without connection to each other.

The web interface is naturally more limited than the clients. There is no
automatic time tracking and no idle detection.
